# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing.

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding the different needs and characteristics of customers. By using K-Means clustering, we can segment customers based on features such as annual income and spending score.


## Installation
